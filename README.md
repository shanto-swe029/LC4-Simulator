# LC4-Simulator

In this project, I've crafted an LC4 simulator, a fundamental tool in understanding computer architecture. Leveraging C programming, I've meticulously implemented functions to replicate LC4's core functionalities, including instruction execution, register manipulation, and memory management. By meticulously parsing assembly code and simulating each instruction, I've created an environment where users can observe program execution and memory states in real-time. This simulator not only serves as an educational tool but also lays the groundwork for more advanced projects in computer architecture and systems programming.
